# Neural-Style-Transfer
Implementation of a neural style transfer model that can take a content image and apply a style (painting).
## Model used
In this project we took a pretrained VGG-19 model and modified it to our needs by using its 5 feature extraction layers (Convolution layers).
## Loss functions and total loss calculation
To train this model we will use two main loss functions. The first one would be the content loss function and the second one would be the style loss function.
